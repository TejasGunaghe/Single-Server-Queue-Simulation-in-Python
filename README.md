IIT Bombay: IEOR


Project's Title: Single-Server-Queue-Simulation-in-Python from scratch

Motivation: This is our assignment for IEOR Lab: The aim is to sreate and study single server queues simulation in python from scratch.
The model is build using OOPS concepts where each arrival(customer) is model as an object.
Following scenarios can be run using this model:
1. FCFS single server queuing system
2. LCFS single server queuing system
3. Queue with jobs feedback (re-working)
